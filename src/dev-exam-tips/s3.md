# S3 Exam Tips (dev)

- S3 is a `Object-Based` storage that allows you to upload files
- Not OS or run a DB storage
- Files from 0 bytes up to `5TB`
- The total value of data and number of objects you can store is `unlimited`
- Files are stored in buckets
- S3 is a global namespace, this means that the buckets must be globally available
- A S3 Object consists in `Value`, `Key`, `Version ID` and `Metadata`

## Secure Buckets

- By default every bucket is `private` (only the owner can read, delete or upload)
- You can use `Bucket Policies` that are applied at a bucket level
- You can use `Access Control Lists (ACLs)` that are applied at a object level
- S3 buckets can be configured to create `Access Logs` (disabled by default), which will log all requests made to a bucket. These logs can be written to another bucket.
