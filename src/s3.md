# Simple Storage Service

<aws-icon icon="s3"></aws-icon>

S3 is an `Object-Based Storage`. Store data as objects rather then in file systems or data block.

## Basics

- The total number of objects and the number of data is unlimited
- S3 objects can be from 0 bytes up to 5 terabytes
- Store files in `Buckets` (similar to folders)

All AWS accounts share the same namespace and each S3 bucket must be globally unique (`https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<key-name>`).

S3 is a `key-value` store, and it stores a key, value, version ID and metadata (e.g. content-type, last-modified, team-name, etc..).

## Availability

S3 is an highly available (99.95% - 99.99% depending on the S3 tier) and highly durable (11 9's durability) service.

## Secure your data

By default every bucket is private (no public access by default). So by default only the owner can read, delete and update files into a bucket.

You can enable server side encryption on the buckets.

You can define `Bucket Policies` to define which actions a user can take on the buckets.

You can protect the access using `Access Control Lists (ACLs)` to define which AWS account can access each resource.

### Encryption Exams Tips

- Encryption `in Transit`: it can use encryption in transit with SSL/TSL or HTTPS
- Encryption `at Rest (server side encryption SSE)`
  - `SSE-S3`: enabled by default, the keys are provided and managed by AWS
  - `SSE-KMS`: the keys are provided by AWS and managed by you
  - `SSE-C`: the keys are provided and managed by you
- `Client Side Encryption` is when you encrypt the file by yourself before uploading it
- `CORS` resource sharing can be allowed to enable a bucket to access resources that are allocated to another S3 bucket

## Tiers

### S3 Standard

Is a highly available and highly durable storage. Designed for `frequent access` and suitable for `most workloads`.

It's stored in at least `3 different Availability Zone`.

### S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3-IA)

Designed for infrequently access data, so data that you may access a few times a month, but not on a daily bases.

Great for long term storage, backups and disaster recovery files.

It provides `Rapid Access`, you `pay to access the data` (low per-GB storage price and a per-GB retrieval fee).

It's stored in at least `3 different Availability Zone`.

### S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3-IA)

Same as the S3-IA but it's available only in one AZ, but costs `20% less` then a regular S3-IA.

### Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive

There are 2 Glacier Options: `Glacier` and `Glacier Deep Archive`.

They are both very cheap and designed for data that needs to be accessed once per year, so good for `archiving data`.

To access data from the normal one it can take from `1 minute` to `12 hours`, while for the second has a `default` retrieval time of `12 hours`.

### S3 - Intelligent Tiering

Automatically moves you data on the most cost-effective tier based on how often you access the data.
