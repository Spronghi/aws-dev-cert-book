# Elastic Compute Cloud

Secure, resizable compute capacity in the Cloud. Is like a `VM` that is hosted on AWS instead of your own data center.

## Pricing Models

- **On Demand**: pay only for the time you are running;
- **Reserved**: reserve capacity for one or three years. Up to 72% discount;
- **Spot**: purchase unused capacity at a massive discount. You decide a price for each instance based on the demand, and when it goes higher the instance get killed;
- **Dedicated**: phisical server running EC2 instances only for you. The most expensive options.

## On Deman

Super flexible, perfect for first time in the cloud or normal applications.

## Reserved Instances

There are three types of reservations:

1. **Standard RIs**: up to 72% off on-demand price. You cannot change to larger or smaller instances types;
2. **Convertible RIs**: up to 54% off on-demand price. You can decide to change the instances type of equal or greater value;
3. **Scheduled RIs**: schedule the reservations between a window of time of the day, week or month.

## Spot Instances

This are perfect for application that need to have a very `low compute prices` or applications that need a `large amount` of additional computing capacity.

## Dedicated

Great for meeting regolatory requirements that do not support multi-tenant virtualization.

1. **On-Demand**: can be purchase on a hourly rate;
2. **Reserved**: can be purchase at a reservation to up to 72% off the on-demand price.
