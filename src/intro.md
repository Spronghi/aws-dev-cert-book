# Introduction

Just some notes for the [AWS Certified Developer - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/).

## Components

For this book I made a web component you can use to fetch AWS icons:

```html
<aws-icon
  icon="iam"
  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html"
></aws-icon>
```
